# Klondike Solitaire Unity Project

## Overview
This project is a prototype of a Klondike Solitaire game developed using Unity's UI Toolkit. The aim was to create a playable version within a tight 48-hour timeframe, focusing on a streamlined development process and modern UI techniques.

## Features
- **UI Development**: Leveraged Unity's UI Toolkit to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
- **Game Mechanics**: Implemented core gameplay mechanics of Klondike Solitaire, including card movement and game state management.
- **Dynamic Screen Management**: Utilized addressable assets to manage different game screens dynamically without the need for separate scenes.
- **Minimalist Design**: Focused on a simple yet effective design that enhances user experience.

## Development Insights
- **Prototyping Challenge**: This project was initiated as a personal challenge to improve my Unity skills under time constraints.
- **UI Toolkit Experience**: Previously, I integrated UI Toolkit with the older UI system, but this project allowed me to fully explore its capabilities.
- **CSS-Like Styling**: Although thereâ€™s limited support for CSS, the styling approach in the UI Toolkit felt familiar and efficient, making it easier to build and modify UI elements.
- **Gameplay Testing**: Due to time constraints, I was unable to fully implement a shuffling algorithm to ensure every game state was winnable.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Unity 2021 or later
- .NET 4.x equivalent

### Installation

2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Ensure all necessary packages are installed via the Unity Package Manager.

### Running the Game
- Press the Play button in the Unity Editor to start the game.
- Navigate through the main menu and select the game mode to begin playing.

## Code Overview
The main classes in the project include:
- **GameStateContainer**: Manages the overall game state and transitions between screens.
- **KlondikeGameMode**: Implements the rules and mechanics specific to Klondike Solitaire.
- **GameResults**: Tracks game outcomes, scores, and player performance.

## Future Improvements
